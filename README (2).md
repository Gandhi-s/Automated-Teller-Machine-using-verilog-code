## Features
- User authentication with PIN verification.
- Balance inquiry.
- Cash withdrawal and deposit simulation.
- Error handling for invalid PINs and insufficient balance.
- Designed using Verilog for FPGA implementation.

## Requirements
- Software:
  - Verilog simulation tools (e.g., ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, or Quartus)
  - Text editor or IDE for Verilog (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Notepad++)
- Hardware (Optional for testing):
  - FPGA board (e.g., Xilinx or Altera)
- Basic knowledge of Verilog syntax and simulation.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gandhi-s/atm-verilog.git

### **7. Describe Usage**
Explain how to simulate and test the project.
```markdown
## Usage
1. Run the Verilog testbench file (`atm_tb.v`) in the simulator.
2. Use the provided input stimulus to test different scenarios:
   - Correct and incorrect PINs.
   - Cash withdrawal with sufficient and insufficient balance.
   - Deposit operations.
3. Observe the outputs for each test case in the waveform or console logs.
